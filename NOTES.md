- co-location :: components & pages are both in app/ together
- page.tsx & layout.tsx
- app/utils/*.ts
- app/components/*.tsx
- app/fonts.ts
- public/*.[png|ico]
- import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts'; // @ is an alias to make import paths simpler
- conditional styling :: clsx{}
- app/dashboard/page.tsx has an async page
- data fetching :: waterfall () vs. parallel
- (folder) is a 'rout group', and won't be part of the url
- adding a loading.tsx file implements page streaming
- specific components streaming is called 'suspense'
- import { useSearchParams, usePathname, useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
- debouncing :: only refresh search query params when user has stopped typing
