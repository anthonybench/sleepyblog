# **SleepyBlog**

_a blog most sleepy._

<br />

## **Welcome to SleepyBlog üëã**

A web app for personal utility, both professional and personal. \
This is a rewrite of my original shot at this, primarily refining UI details and focusing on responsive layout.

SleepyBlog serves as a convenient place to host my resume, document my land development journey with my partner Jean, a gallery for projects, and any other personal whimsies.

Thanks to my loving partner Jean for buying land and developing it with me. I couldn't have done any of this without her. \
And as well, to every mentor that has encouraged me to siphon knowledge form them.
