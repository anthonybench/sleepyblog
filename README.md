## **Welcome to SleepyBlog üëã**

A web app for personal utility, both career and professional.

SleepyBlog serves as a convenient place to host my resume, document my land development journey with my partner Jean, a gallery for projects, and any other personal whimsies.

## **Get Started üöÄ**

<hr>

This app is hosted on vercel, with namecheap as it's dns provider. \
Later, its design will be overhauled, dockerized, and migrated to the cloud.

As it stands, this app is simple:
```sh
npm i
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run dev
npm build
```

Git hooks are maintained via husky, which is further explained in the [usage section](#usage-), and can be installed with:
```sh
npx husky init
```

Vercel's ci/cd via GitHub app connection automatically rebuilds pushes to the `main` branch into production. Only the repository owner can force push.

<br />

## **Usage ‚öô**

<hr>

The core anatomy is as such:
| Path Glob | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `_posts/*` | blog posts |
| `_tools/*` | tools to support workflow & maintenance |
| `app/_components/*` | react components  |
| `app/_lib/*` | typescript & css utilities, themes and other global objects |
| `app/about/*` | resume & connect page |
| `app/furniture/*` | furniture gallery |
| `app/software/*` | software gallery |
| `app/tutoring/*` | tutoring interface |
| `app/posts/*` | blog post view |
| `public/assets/general/*` | images and other files for the rest of sleepyblog |

As for git hooks, file `.husky/pre-commit` will be run before a commit, and is both for formatting and setting the last updated date displayed in the side-nav footer.
