## BACKLOG
- replace react-modal with shadcn's dialog
- selected navlink has static styles, make them dynamic
- can't navigate internal links when you refresh while in a post view
- linkedin badge doesn't respond to light/dark change, likely because it's some stupid script, maybe do a server-action thing
- linkedin badge disappears when you navigate away & back, refresh fixes it but kills my theme state so that's a no-go
