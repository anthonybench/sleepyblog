## Plans, am I right?
We've began clearing, getting rhythm is hard when you can't yet forsee all of the construction details, our sense of priority isn't there yet. We did however pick up a chicken coop, so I'm stoked for the distant future when I get to play with that 🐔🐔🐔

We've also started accumulating equipment; a generator, wood chipper and such. We've been working with a general contractor on configuring our first house's floor plan (based on one of their stock plans), the other day we looked at samples of features and build options at one of their showrooms offices. \
As you'd expect, they really get you with the up-sells.

over a week goes by of figuring out pricing with them, and by the time we had what we wanted, they'd have taken about $182k for a roughly 850*sqft* house. After hearing "*no*" or "*that'll cost you much more*" a handful of times, I said fuck it. Let's be our own general contractor.

To go owner-builder in our county, it's literally just a checkbox on the permit application. We started looking up contractors in the area, and hit up referrals from our neighbors to start putting together our sub-contractors. \
This is going to be a very busy summer...
