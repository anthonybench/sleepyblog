## Jean, I love you so much

I have an incredible partner, none of this would have been possible without her. She's taken everything thrown at us with stoicism I simply don't even pretend to have.

Not just the house, but the camper, the utilities, equipment rentals, everything. ALl the things that are likely invisible to an observer, Jean and I have tossed tasks endlessly back and forth to each other, and anything that has ever landed in her court has been handled well, no exceptions.

I can't help but look up to you Jean. You're the best role model I have. Longer than I've known you, for over a decade now, I've wanted to buy land and draw & build a house. It's funny to me that now when I think about the dream house and the rest of my life, it doesn't have any substance without you in the picture. Not even sure I'd want it without it you at all.

For those who didn't know (I think between `3` and `0` people read this blog, so not sure who I'm referring to ðŸ¤£), Jean and I are both remote software engineers, and we've shared an office for just over 4 years now. We work next to each other all day every day, and work on the house every day after work and all weekend, and I still get so excited waking up next to you. We've been enduring a **_very_** long stress test, and we're finally able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. You're the best partner I could ever have, you're kind, supportive, patient, honest and hard working.

I love you, and one day I'll marry you. \
Happy birthday, you big ol' bean.

-- Buddy
