## Tieing up loose ends in the exterior
We have a porch pad! Thanks to PAL concrete for doing a way better job than we would have! 🎉

As siding and entry door installation approaches, we're scrambling to dry up the house and plan our insulation & gutter work. \
I'm about to own more scaffolding than I ever wanted I suppose 🤷‍♀️

So after a bunch of miscellaneous stuff like insulating empty cavities in the shed, some electrical corrections, days of crawling around the crawlspace weatherproofing, drying and mold abating (😭), and caulking and spray foaming gaps and cracks, we're now painfully close to closing the final chapter on exterior work.

Not to mention, power is getting turned on by the end of tomorrow!

The next post will be possibly the most exciting one yet, as we should have the entry door dialed in, and the siding on both the house and the well house done! Hopefully by the time the contractors finish with that, we'll be done preparing crawlspace for insulation. We'll have to rent the biggest box truck Home Depot has to *maybe* get all the insulation in one trip. \
Since we live in a very wet part of the world, after reading a ton on crawlspace insulation, we decided to go full-overkill:
* ● black visqueen overlapping generously with full coverage over ground
* ● killz everywhere
* ● standard R30 batts
* ● and the real fanciness; 1/2" foam board to cover the bats that we'll spray with waterproof sealant prior

Mold won't stand a chance under the house! 💪
