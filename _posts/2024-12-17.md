## Now with âœ¨insulationâœ¨

Hadn't realized it had been over a month since I last posted, there were a lot of late nights in the last 4 weeks!

We now have the well house completely insulated, which also meant drywalling the ceiling in the bedroom, office, bathroom and little hallway in order to hold the blow in. \
Jean got to sit up there with the hose and aim the blow-in, I was kinda jealous, but as our trusses can't hold too much downwards weight on a single joist, Jean being the lighter of the two got voluntold to do it ðŸ¤£

One thing that was interesting was deciding what to do with the attic insulation transition between the vaulted and un-vaulted ceiling. We decided to tape & staple of a wall of visquene to seal the barier, staple doubled-up faced batting (R19) across the barier to give us R38, then that will wall off the blow-in as well. \
We stapled flags at 21 inches to fill to, which gave us (with fiberglass blow-in) just over R60.

The vault just took R38 faces batts, though before hand I baffled up 3/4 of the way up every attic cavity so that, in addition to the obvious soffit venting there, also keep batts off the radiant barrier foil on the inside of my roof sheathing. Really excited to see how cool that stuff keeps the house.

I get to take my first break in a while, both from this house work and my job, starting this Saturday (or Friday night if we get stuff done early). At this point, the last thing I need to do is build in some last-minute framing additions, namely to modify the small hallway into an arch (kinda excited to bull nose that when drywalling) and sheath some built-in cabinet spaces while I can.
