## ❄️❄️❄️ Finally taking a break ❄️❄️❄️

Here's an absurdly cute overlay of a few images in front of our in-progress home, Jean did an amazing job on it with [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).

It's xmas eve now, in the midst of a 12 day break from both house work and my job. We left things in a good spot; all things insulation are done, drywalling has already started, and the arch addition is already built/assembled and just needs to get fastened to the hallway opening once i'm back. we should probably deal with the gutters on the well house & house when we return too, before we start seriously focusing on drywall.

Hope everyone's drinking enough eggnog! 🥚
