## I Can't believe I fit through that bottleneck
More honestly, I wouldn't have gotten through this month without great friends & neighbors. \
Starting from the beginning...

My longest-standing friend (since kindergarten!) is having a wedding in Chicago, and I'm fortunate enough to officiate the ceremony (congratulations Matt ðŸ¥‚). \
That's awesome, but as we'll be out for a week, \
and rain is rearing it's head, \
and I still needed to plumb and wire the pressure tank to the well, \
and backfill the trench, \
and cover the well casing with bentonite chips (hard to get off your boots). \
and frame an entire shed, \
I was starting to worry if we were gonna get everything done before the wedding.

Sunset is getting progressively earlier, and since it's raining more, things are starting to get muddy, and I have to spend more time tarping things and putting them away.

As time was running out, I gave siding and roofing the shed to my contractors. Kinda sad about that since it's only an 8x8 with a gentle pitch, but it is what it is ðŸ™ƒ

As I started getting the plumbing together and figure out the wiring, Jean got sick. \
Like, really sick. The sickest I've ever seen her. \
There was no way she could keep coming out to the property to work with me, and there was also no way I was gonna finish all that work and frame the whole with the lean-to shelter alone in 2 weeks (the plans included ~16' long beams), so I called in every favor I could. \
Asked my manager for some time off from then until the wedding, \
Called friends and asked if any were crazy enough to help me lift the beams & walls up, \
Asked neighbors and contractors for advice on the electric, and scrambled to design the plumbing layout and buy the parts in time (way too many trips to ferguson). Did I mention I only knew elementary plumbing prior?

Because things apparently weren't spicy enough doing it alone, when our permits got released, I found out there was a "pre-erosion inspection" I have to clear before anything else can be done, and that I have to get a number of erosion control measures inspected every week during construction, which constituted covering all exposed dirt with straw, installing about 100' of silt fencing (that part was especially dumb), and putting tarps on top of all dirt piles.

I had about 2 weeks to do all that, which felt impossible, and the consequences of not getting it done where holding up construction progress with the rainy season *very* imminent. I know you *can* frame in the rain, and then use equipment to bring th moisture levels in the house back down, but I really didn't want to do that.

Sparing other details to keep this post from being a novel, towards the end I put 9 12-14 hours days into it since I got work off. Framing alone with a headlamp in the dark when you're so tired you can't balance is quite an experience.

Thanks to that time off and great friends giving me a hand, it all got finished. Jean felt good enough to come out the night before we left (still hadn't packed) and we tyvek'd the shed together. We got back home around 11:30pm to pack. I definitely found my limits for exhaustion, and hope it never comes down to the wire like that again. I'm writing this on the plane right now, can't believe we got it all done. Everything hurts, but at least construction can keep moving.

Really looking forward to sleeping more than 4 hours.

They say the universe speaks to you through circumstance. \
I think this month it was saying to me "*yeah, but how bad do you **really** want it?*"

Oh, almost forgot to mention. Months back when I was a poor, naive boy, I told my friend Cameron I'd run in the beaverton half-marathon with him. Because i didn't have time to train, I just signed up for the 10k. It was the 14th I think, and if I was sane I would have bailed, but I have a hard time bailing on anything, so amidst the craziness I got up at 6 to get there one saturday morning and run with him before I went to the property to work. Given that I haven't been running for quite a while, it actually felt pretty fine, in fact I think I paced myself a little too conservatively. I guess running around digging and carrying shit has it's benefits.

Just a bit more scrambling when we get back from Chicago. Hopefully Jean's in fighting shape, and we can finish the exterior work and finally be working inside the shell of the house. I think by then, a break might be in order...
