## Get it...like, priming..

Splash Blocks finished! Gave a coat of concrete seal and placed them, used a bonding agent to secure the extension pieces to the main component, we'll see if that holds up over winter, I kind of have my doubts. Fun side quest regardless.

We finished all mudding, sanding everything down was a lot more sanity draining then I imaged it would be, we went through the house room by room and turned off all lights aside from one harsh light placed to the side of the wall we were sanding, at an angle from the floor. The imperfections cast shadows, and you just have to keep sanding until there aren't any left. You can really lose your mind trying to get that perfect. Somehow we got through the house.

Cleaning was another story, all the dust from the entire drywall process needed evacuation. After getting all the craft paper off the floor and cleaning all the tools, ladders and scaffolding, we bought a leaf blower off facebook marketplace and rented an air scrubber from home depot. With the 2 home made air scrubbers and the rental (which honestly was pretty underwhelming, just make your own) we shuffled them around the house, blew as much dust as we could out of the windows and door, and then for a few hours borrowed fans from a neighbor and pointed those out the door. Basically lots of repositioning things and trying to move as much dusty air as possible. After roughly 3 days we were left with a house you could walk in without a respirator.

We started masking the house in lieu of priming and painting, and that's when the (admittedly bad) wiring job on my trailer eventually started to fall apart on me. I took it as a sign to overhaul lots of things on the trailer, and replace all the stock fence pockets for better fitting ones. I then built another fence, and covered everything with black deck paint to make it last a few more years. Finally, I ordered some new trailer wiring with nylon mesh guard on it, pretty neat stuff. Some new copper washers, new splices, and more thoughtful cable management later, the trailer is now looking like it should have from the beginning, rather satisfying.

In spare moments, I started cutting cedar capping for the well house exterior trim. There are parts (mostly end grain) that don't hold up to the wet months very well, and so capping with some cedar along with a fresh coat of linseed oil and spar urethane should do the trick.

We hope to be priming and get started with paint next weekend. By next post, I hope to have some pretty photos of a painted interior!
