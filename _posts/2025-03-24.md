## Ready to tackle level-5 smooth finish!

Calling in our "_sheetrock nailing inspection_" this week, as soon as we get some water heater stuffs tied up and finish sheeting the final wall in the pantry closet. So excited to have the last very-unpleasant (or so I think) part of the build behind me.

We had a lot of drywall waste, turns out it's not trivial to estimate how one uses cut offs to economize their usage, for full builds at least 🤷‍♀️

We're also now planning on buying a camper trailer and moving onto the property so we can work around the clock (outside of our jobs) to reach the finish line quicker. This next month will be exhausting, as moving already sucks, we won't be hiring movers, and we've been living in our current spot in Vancouver for over 3 years. That's more than enough time to collect a bunch of crap you didn't know you had 🫠 \
Bonus fun points for figuring out fitting everything in the 2 shipping containers and camper, since the house is still in the messy phases of construction and it can't hold anything 🎉

We had to figure out adding another breaker and plug for a 30amp camper hookup, and learn a few things about campers, but touring a few at a dealership really helped explain how they work. Once we get a PO box in Washougal setup and get on the other side of moving, we'll be able to work fast. The only part of the remaining build I have no experience with is smooth finishing the drywall, and doing knockdown texture on ceilings, so I'm a little anxious on how long that might take...

All this, and STILL don't have internet installed. It's been a whole thing I don't even feel like describing 🤣😭
