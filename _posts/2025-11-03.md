## Almost there...

We now have a date planned for to call in our final inspection: \
✨_November 17th_✨

We have gotten pretty much everything dialed in. I meant to write a post when I finished plumbing, that was a couple weeks ago. Running water (hot water at that) has been game changing! The kitchen is entirely functional for the most part. We still only have our mini fridge and our "real" fridge, but excitingly, that's coming in this Thursday.

Jean's been putting certain things away and tieing up loose ends while I've been milling the base trim. Out of the 10 continuous runs of base trim left in the house, I've milled 7 of them. Most of them are still going through the finishing process (2 coats of fireproofing on the back, one coat of watco natural on the front, and a top coat of satin floor finish), but the rest of them are all planned out. We're all out of good weather at this point, so doing all the wood working in tents has been a challenge to say the least, but we're managing.

Apart from building the trim and installing it, we just have the toilet to install, and it's sitting here ready to go. Only reason I haven't installed it yet is because we've been figuring out the sliding glass shower door for our shower stall, which apparently is quite nuanced. We finally have that ordered, and I'd rather the toilet not be in for when I have to install the shower door. I've never installed a shower door, and the space is tight, so the toilet would likely be a pain to work around.

So we have 2 weeks to finish up trim, install the shower door, and install the toilet!

We'll be taking some PTO from the final inspection day onwards to celebrate an unwind, this will mark the end of a 20.5 month journey. We're so exhausted, but it's finally almost over...
