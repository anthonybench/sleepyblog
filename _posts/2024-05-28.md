## Cruising Through Milestones
Have you ever made a ton of progress on something, and you take a few steps back to admire it...and it looks the same?

Got the contractors in place for the trades we're not doing. \
Played fix-it/break-it with the wood chipper a few times ðŸŽ‰. \
Set up a big new tent from costco, designed as a car port. Surprisingly well made! Don't set it up in the dark though, you'll have a close call with your finger (heard from a friend...)

Slicing open my finger didn't make me work faster that's for sure, but did make for harder shoveling ðŸ˜…

Jean used the electric saw for a while, picked it up quick! We knocked out a ton of smaller chores like digging out a marathon of stumps, cleared a lot more space in our immediate work area, installed a peg board in the shed, and bought some PT lumber to build an axe throwing target. Looking forward to that!
