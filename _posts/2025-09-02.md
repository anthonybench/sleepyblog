## Final Stretch...

Painting is finally done, and just âœ¨***look at that arch***âœ¨

We've now been ordering/fetching the final materials; counter tops, sinks, flooring, miscellaneous electrical fixtures. I've been putting in switches, outlets, lights, and smoke detectors. A few things that still need figuring out, but I'm more than half way done with the finish electric now, and happy I have a friendly electrician I can text every so often (sorry for bothering you all the time Scott...)

Although I forgot to get pictures of it, we also got the well house exterior trim capped with Cedar, and Jean is applying a 2-part epoxy to the seams now, some outdoor wood bondo product, seems pretty strong. We'll oil and spar-urethane it before the rainy months show up, and that should be dramatically better protection.

We also side-quested a big table, our friend's parents had a huge 8-person outdoor table, with all the chairs and a pretty sturdy umbrella, so when we rented a van to pick up the base trim from CrossCut Hardwoods, we swung by and took that off their hands too. It needed some TLC, so Jean bleached it, scrubbed, and washed it, and I threw on 4 coats of concrete seal, and now it looks good as new now!

From here, I just need to throw in the rest of the electrical fixtures and install the cabinets, then I can start flooring while Jean works on the well house exterior. \
With the exception of a few build materials like wall paper and our bathroom floor tile that will take a long time to come in, we should be able to have everything else done in October!

SO CLOSE ðŸ˜«
