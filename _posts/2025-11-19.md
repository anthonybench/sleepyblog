## Final Inspection + Proposal = ✅

This Monday we had our final inspection after a little pre-mature celebration (would've made it comical if we didn't pass) and finishing the rest of the work. Installed the toilet, installed the shower door (filing aluminum corners to fit a radius is irksome) and shot in the rest of the trim. Everything works great with no leaks, and I/we couldn't be more relieved 😮‍💨

Immediately after shaking the inspectors hand, I ran back inside and grabbed the engagement ring I've had prepared, and proposed. Had a bouquet of lego roses and a reservation at Ox that night. Possibly one of the happiest and most relieving moments of my entire life, un-dramatically.

It's been 2 days since, meant to write this post sooner but I had some sleep to finally catch up on. At the time of writing, we still have 11 days of our PTO break before we go back. Everyone said I'd feel weird and anxious not working all day...I'd say I'm doing alright 😴

As I think I've said several times before, I'm not really a wordsmith, or the blogger type. Whoever the hell read all this, thanks! I wouldn't blame anyone for not reading it though, half the time I posted I was so tired it was hard not to fall asleep while I was sitting down. I'm sure it showed 🤣

This experiment is finally over. Key conclusions:

    - Building a house is hard (someone should've told me!).
    - Ignoring raw land work such as survey, forestry and utilities, 2 middle class earners can have a brand new custom designed home as long as they're willing to learn EVERYTHING and do all physically viable work, without substantial savings.
    - Having working plumbing fixtures & appliances in your area of residence is wildly underrated.
    - For landscaping at scale, you need heavy equipment, tractor at minimum. The amount of time it takes to manually dig out stumps, utility trenches, and move dirt manually cripples your ability to do anything else. Bad news is I have to buy a tractor, good news is I get to buy a tractor.

Of the things I've never done before, the most entertaining things were:

    - Soffit vent baffling.
    - The plumbing and electric for the well house. Figuring out how well systems work was genuinely enlightening.
    - Making an arch.
    - Bull nose drywall corners.

And the things I'd not before that were very much _not_ entertaining:

    - Crawlspace insulation
    - Drywall sanding for a smooth finish (_*shudders_)
    - How Camper trailers work (hvac, plumbing, electric)
      - ☝️ this probably only sucked because we had very little time to figure it out

So grateful to live in a house Jean and I built together. We didn't cut corners and built and installed everything with care, I'm so proud of us. In front of us now are all of the fun projects, like building a proper workshop or laying huge patios with cool brick patterns.

Thanks to all of my friends and family, your encouragement was all I needed 🙇
