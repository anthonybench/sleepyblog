## Words can not describe...

We got our kitchen backsplash in, and having seamless quartz slab everywhere looks amazing! After flooring and shooting in most of the quarter round and trim on the base cabinets, we phoned a friend to help us move our oven from one of the shipping containers into the house, and did the install. We then had our first dinner cooked in the home! Amazing, thanks again Nicholas!

Jean is nearly done with the bathroom tile floor, it's looking great so far, and we're starting to finally get creature comforts back in our lives like a vacuum cleaner, a counter to sit at and work....and best bed either of us have ever had.

For anyone who cares (i don't know why you would 🤣) It's Purple's ✨_Rejuvenate Premier_✨ king with the smart base. The smart base lights up under the bed per it's motion detector, the idea is the floor is lit up when you have to get up in the middle of the night, so you don't have to flip a light on or use your phone light. The base has pneumatic cylinders and a bunch of motors, and will origami the mattress in several ways via the remote. Last night was the first ***really*** good night's sleep I've had in 2 years, and that's not an exaggeration. I can already feel myself suppressing the memories of sleeping in the camper 😮‍💨

Got my final tent wood shop set up to do the base trim, and have started plumbing things in already. Apart from a small list of miscellaneous bits, plumbing and base trim are really the only things left before we call in our final inspection! A fridge would be nice though...
