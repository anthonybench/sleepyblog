## Legend says they're still mudding to this day...
I remember when I told myself I'd post here twice a month. \
I was so cute back then...

Although our construction permit has another year on it, our electrical permit expires mid October. We could pay to apply for an extension, but who wants that, so there's our target date to move in. Fingers crossed!

Things have been moving fast, and to make time tables work, we've started breaking down a bit and hiring a few things to shave off time. Budget doesn't allow to hire everything else out, so there are hard limits, but the advantage to being your own general contractor is you can pay for things one at a time while collecting salary, in our case enough so to hire out gutters and exterior paint. \
Sounds mundane, but I was kinda really looking forward to building my gutter assembly. We went with a size-6 K gutter, apparently half-rounds trade aesthetics for performance, K's hold more water AND weigh less, crazy.

I think I also have our garbage system pretty dialed in. Our trailer can hold up to 8 city-sized garbage bins (the ones you drag up and down your driveway every week), and lazy napkin math says it would take ~3 months to fill them all, so once life is in "_steady state_", I'll only need to do a dump run 4 times a year, and said dump runs will only cost about $30. \
Looking at [garbage service prices in the suburbs](https://wcnorthwest.com/residential-rates), at the time of writing most folks are paying up to ~$75 a month depending on service tier. To top it off, our closest dump is low-key beautiful, 12 minutes away, and it's called "_Mt. Pleasant_" ‚õ∞Ô∏è. Recycling and E-Cycling is free there too, and when you consider we don't pay for water or have state income taxes, our COL is kinda üî• \
Ok ok, shut up.

So in between work items, I've been playing around with concrete mix and pigments. Including the well-house, we have 5 downspouts, and while I want to dry-well and/or rain-barrel them eventually, for now we need splash blocks. I ordered some splash block concrete molds from Ukraine, and have been dialing in water and pigment composition to try to get good results. Don't have pictures yet, but once they're done I'll share üéâ

As for the paint, Jean gets a lot of credit for picking the colors. We wanted a "tasteful modern shrek" palette, and I think we nailed it. Gutters went on first so they could paint them to blend in with the house. \
Something cool that had never crossed my mind, but things like our electrical service panel, septic control box, conduit and exterior outlet covers all got painted too to blend in with the house. I don't think I've ever seen that detail on other houses before, but it's so satisfying. If you're a home owner reading this, don't be shy to paint that stuff to blend in with your house, such a nice touch!

Mudding sucks, but all this extra coating we're doing in the effort to nail the smooth finish is finally visually paying off. We're not quite done yet, but all tape is embedded (that 18' ridge was fucking tough) and most things have all their cover coats. We hired a drywaller who specializes in texture (didn't know that existed) to help us speed up the scim coating at the end. On the days he comes to help, I'll take PTO and work with him. He came by to look at our work and discuss how he could help, and I learned a ton just in that brief interaction. \
We're throwing everything we have at it to get drywall done by August 1st, and it looks like we might just pull it off...
