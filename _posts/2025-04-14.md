## Camper Trailer Reno Speedrun
With our camper trailer now parked and plugged in, we got to work asap on fixing the most immediate things. After taking the old stabilizer jacks off and fetching new ones, it turns on the flange on the chassis isn't wide enough, so will have to pull my welder out of the shipping container (in the back behind everything, naturally) and get bigger plates on to install the new ones. Plumbing looks good, and electric only needed new bulbs & fuses, though will have to install new fixtures in a couple spots and deep clean the condenser in the fridge. AC unit looks like it ought to get replaced from all the crap on the intake, but will have to care about that another time.

As with any old camper, the inside is gross, so we ripped out the couch, some framing, and the plywood for the bed. Water damage has swelled up the mdf on the bottoms of the cabinetry, so will be cutting that out with the oscillating cutter and putting in a marine-ply toe kick or something to that effect. We bought a new roll of linoleum and some glue, and will be re-flooring it too. \
I've seen a ton of robertson screws in the couch framing, so I'm wondering if the this thing was built or last reno'd in Canada. Must have been ages ago, because the wood was so swollen around them and the heads were so rotted out that I got to exercise my grabit screw extractors more than I ever wanted to ðŸ¤£

Jean took the curtains and valences off to re construct them, which should be a really nice touch. Once it's cleaned, re-floored and stabilized, it should be a good enough temporary home to get us through the rest of our house construction. If I hate it enough, there's always breaking the tent out, I checked last night while working up there and our old camp spot is still perfectly cleared out. That was only a year ago, but already feels nostalgic...

As for the house itself, our cabinets shop finished the builds, so we got a box truck to pick them up and tetris them into one of our shipping containers. Between that and getting the camper ready, it's been hard to make a ton of progress on the mudding and taping, but we're very close to finishing all that work on one side of the house (the not-living room half). \
On that note, I really really really hate mud&taping overhead. \
Really.

Happy with how strong the vinyl bull nose bead pieces are on the wall, I went overboard and used spray adhesive, staples and drywall nails. You heard me, all three of them....I know I have a problem.

Taking a break for Jean's bday soon, have stuffs planned, and really looking forward to a break. Hoping by May, the camper renovation will be done, and that we have everything including texture coat in the not-living room half. Seems maybe too optimistic, but I'm a dreamer.
