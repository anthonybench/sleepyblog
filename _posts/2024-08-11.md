## Time to phone a friend, or nine
The shipping containers are now permanently placed, after a long run around of getting the right chains to hoist it (thanks Ron!). \
It will have to be moved again once the bigger home is underway, but it'll have to do for now. We have the miter saw, welding equipment and a few miscellaneous things stuffed in there already, soon to be much more.

In an attempt to hit fast-forward on the well house preparations, I lured some nice friends with bbq and exploited them for labor (actually I didn't cook either, thanks Brandon). Got a ton burned, chipped, cut & hauled yesterday, but after removing one stump (thanks Cameron) and measuring, it looks like I'll have to fell another tree and rip it's stump out too for the well house slab to fit.

Will we be able to do that, trench the utility lines, and build the well house in time though, my faith is starting to waiver ðŸ« 

Still had fun and got a ton of stuff done, so celebrate the small wins. Thanks guys!
