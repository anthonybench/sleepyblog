## But what if we lived where we worked

Driveway & parking lot are done! \
Septic system is done, and awaiting a house & power to interface with! \
We now have a porta-potty on site for camping & construction convenience! \
And after taking the engine off it's seat to swap belts on the stupid wood chipper, fired it up with freshly greased bearings and 👌👌👌, chips branches like a beast now (phew).

We also set up our long-term-temporary camp site, and this weekend marks the first that we're gonna start sleeping there so we can work all day. Realized we don't have enough water storage (have to use the generator to power the well, and that's not super convenient every time we want water), so we rush-ordered a 7 gallon water tank to take with us. Jean and I won't drink that much, but we'll also have a couple dogs we're watching this weekend so we'll have to keep them hydrated, and tent with them (always something 🤣).

In general, so excited to finally be spending way more time there and work my/our asses off. Something software engineering made me deeply admire that I had taken for granted in my previous life is movement. \
I use to live a very active life, and `covid + white-collar desk work` really made activity and health take something of a nose dive. They say [sitting can be seriously detrimental to your health](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Sitting-is-the-New-Smoking.aspx#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20analyzed%20a%20total,caused%20by%20obesity%20and%20smoking.), and honestly I believe it now. \
Plus admittedly I just miss being dirty and tired, so after a week or two to iron out the wrinkles in our workflow and campsite, I think we'll have a very happy Isaac. Hopefully a happy Jean too 🤞🤣

Oh, and archery. \
I've half-gotten-into archery prior in life a couple times, but never bought a bow or anything, and so we bought a bow, some arrows, and a target. We got to unbox and play with that for a minute, and already lost an arrow in our woods 👍
