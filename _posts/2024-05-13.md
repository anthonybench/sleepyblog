## Welcome to camp *Buddy&Bean* üèïÔ∏è
Although we're tenting with two dogs which ups our need for space and water, this weekend was more productive than I thought it would be for a first go at it. Luka (golden doodle) even chewed up a few sticks, so I guess he helped mulch in a sense...

A lot of path clearing and tree cutting, with a few long-term camp setup bits here and there. I think my cute little 12" electric chainsaw is very much not going to keep up with the demands here, so I'm now pretty sure I need a 16" or 20" gas saw. Wop wop.

We picked up a JetBoil burner for boiling water, and boy do I admire good engineering. It performs surprisingly well, I guess camping stoves have come a long way from what I last remember.

I think I'm finding my rhythm with processing timber, and we've now cleared a sizable amount of blackberry bushes leaving a much larger walkable space now. Very excited to upgrade my saw and really eat through the fallen trees.

If anyone reading this has some tables, tarps, tents, chairs, or really anything else that's wasting space in their garage, I know a couple that would be grateful to help them free up that space! ü§£
