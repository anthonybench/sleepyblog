## I take big wood and turn it into smaller woods
After much more cutting and shuffling, we've processed majority of the stuff in our way \
...just in time to change our plans entirely üòµ‚Äçüí´

We're now going to place the shipping containers elsewhere as a long-term temporary placement, which we're realizing also entails having some hoist cables made for our 20 foot containers (there are loops at the corners for pulling them up with an excavator, which apparently not all containers have, so lucky us I suppose). \
It's really just to speed things up; there's a bunch of stuff we need to purchase to be ready for construction (siding, welding equipment, insulation batts, windows and door to name most), and we can't stuff them into the containers until they're placed off the gravel, thus out of the way of trucks turning around.

I think we can now focus on beginning to build the well house now. I learned more about trench diggers, and although it's like $300 to rent one for a day, digging several yards of 3' trenches would just take way too long. I also learned that trench diggers that big are ride-on, so can't act like I'm not looking forward to that ü§ì

Oh, and we had a bbq, during which I forgot to take pictures, luckily Jean took pictures of the dogs...good enough ü§£ \
A few of our friends are down to help work too, so we're organizing a '*work party*'‚Ñ¢Ô∏è with as many people as I can get for August 10th, wish me luck in my recruitment!
