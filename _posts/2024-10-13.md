## Your boy has never been *this* sleepy before...
Ok I'm totally burnt so we'll make this simple:

- ● the service panel for our meter is trenched and set ✅
- ● carpenters have made insane progress on the house, all 4 walls are up, windows & door rough openings are cased, and interior walls are framed (thanks [Dune Homes](https://www.instagram.com/dunecustomhomes/)!) ✅
- ● installed the entry door on the well house (actually turned out virtually perfect 😎) ✅
- ● exterior tongue & groove pine ceiling mostly finished (ugh) ✅

We're honing in on getting the gutters on and installing the electrical fixtures inside the well house, after we finish the exterior ceiling.

Everything is starting to feel emotional, as we drag ourselves around the property exhausted, we can now see our future home. \
An overused word perhaps, but the feeling I get looking at the rough framing of this house I've been working towards is surreal. I couldn't possibly explain what that's like to whoever is reading this (likely nobody 🤣) so I won't try.

So close.
