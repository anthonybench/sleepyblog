## Feeling refreshed

Got an order from GTS in the house, and started drywalling. \
Including the overhead sheets we already installed to hold the blow-in, it's something close to 150 8' sheets, but too lazy add receipts together.

We've been painting kilz on interior wall studs as we've been going, and buying remaining tools needed to do the finishing down the road. I wired more lights in, and Jean taped up foam board seems in the crawlspace, though also found out that some moisture was trapped in the floor joists, so she cut a few seems to breath it where ever there was condensation.

As internet is hopefully getting worked out now, it won't be long until we call for the _sheet rocking nailing inspection_, which is the **_last_** inspection until the final!

Predictions:

- ‚óè We'll be starting mud&tape at the end of February
- ‚óè We'll be painting at the end of March
- ‚óè We'll be flooring in April
- ‚óè We'll schedule our final inspection in June
