## Cabinets, Counter Tops, Flooring and more!

So this should have been several posts...but the moment I'm horizontal I'm asleep so that's my excuse 🤣

Installed the cabinets and some of the trim package that came with them, I've never installed peninsula cabinets before, and didn't know they were anchored at the bottom under the toe kick. Our very high tech workflow for setting the wall cabinets was to have jean hold them on her head while I drilled. She put a sponge on her head to cushion the weight...I don't know why she stays with me either \
The only interesting parts were the spacer piece that takes care of the gap on one side of the dishwasher, and fishing 12 gauge through the toe kick for a 20a outlet I'll wire in some day.

Counter tops were pretty exciting, somehow more exciting than the paint. Just having them makes the house feel markedly less construction-y. The quarts guys will come back in a few days to put in "full height backsplash", which we originally planned to do ourselves until we found out you can have backsplash made that's the same slab/material as the counter top itself, and that you can have it go all the way to the wall cabints! That was way too cool to pass up!

Electric and HVAC are also completely finished, Thanks to Hendrickson HVAC for helping us get our heat pump & mini-split setup working! We have 3 heat zones in the house (overkill, I know), and now that practically all contract work is over (except a wallpaper installer coming to help us out soon), we were able to start sleeping in the house. \
Words can not describe how nice it was to sleep in an air conditioned space where I can stretch my legs when I sleep. Fucking amazing.

Jean is handling the bathroom tile, and did a fancy thing I'd never seen before where the trim extends upwards to meet the toilet valve evenly. I'm more than halfway done flooring the rest of the house, and although everyone says this about their new floor, I'm loving it so far. Pretty soon, the only things left to do before final inspection will be plumbing the fixtures and appliances in, and installing the hardwood trim everywhere. I started poking at plumbing stuff, and hoping the p-trap and garbage disposal won't bee to frustrating.

SO CLOSE.

Oh, and we passed our final electrical inspection 💅✨
