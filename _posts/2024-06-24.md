## So many things got done...but everything looks the same
Most construction details at this point are fairly well understood, from utility lines to auxillary structure placement. \
That's certainly a win, but more of a red-tape win

Made a lot of progress cutting that giant pile of trees to, we've run out of convenient open space to stack logs, so it's a side quest every now and then to clear new spaces between trees for new stacks. We had to give up on the last wood chipper, and after an epic saga of getting a new roughly ***1000lbs*** chipper with a 20hp engine up to the land, offloaded and assembled (our trailer is only rated for 1100lbs too, so going up hills was really pushing it...) we now have a beastly piece of equipment eating sticks & branches faster than we can feed it.

But wouldn't it be awesome if *everything* worked when you bought it? \
Now I have to return the new gas saw (Sthil farm boss) into Parkrose Hardware repairs because it won't start. I'm somewhat convinced the engine is hydrolocked, but I can't get the stupid sparkplug off to see if it's flooded so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So it's one step foreword, one step back. In more fun (funner should be a word) news, I'm just about done with my axe throwing target, just need to fill the sacrificial backer with target material, basically I'd cut 5' lengths of logs, and then cut them into squares, and use good ol' tightbond 3 (the waterproof stuff) to fix them to the backer. I imaging that thing gets pretty heavy when full, so I'll likely need help. I cut handles onto it expecting It'll help. \
We also made a cute little target stand for the archery target.

We've met several contractors at the property at this point, and we only have to sign with 2 more contractors before all the planning is officially over. Thereafter, all we do is wait for our construction permits to come back from the county, and we break ground...
