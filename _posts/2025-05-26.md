## Too much to summarize!
With everything stuffed in a storage unit, and essentials moved over to the finally-renovated camper (jk, still adjusting things, but good enough to live in) we made the cut-over to living here full time!

To rifle off highlights:
- After many shenanigans, we got internet working via getting off the starlink waitlist just in time. After testing a few positions and Jean finding the fastener-less roof mount system, we put stacked the scaffolds with the outdoor feet and outriggers, and got it set in a decent spot on the roof where the cable can reach inside the trailer through a window. Performance is surprising, with download speeds between `150Gbps` and `250gbps` depending on the hour. Latency is less spectacular, with ping to google at high variability, and averaging `25ms`. Guess I'll never be a competitive starcraft player now...
- Portapotty set back up on the property, as I took out the toilet in the camper, as one does when they buy a 2006 camper off FB-marketplace.
- Gym membership at a 24hr gym in Washougal so we can take showers. Unlike last summer, we're mostly working inside the house, so while not as sweaty as last year, garden hose showers for 4 months wouldn't be all that fun ðŸ˜…

Don't wanna get too distracted on making the camper nice when we're trying to finish the house, but the stabilizer jacks that came on it were all sorts of fucked up, so gotta jerryrig something to stabilize it. A bit of cable management, shelving and Jean making curtains is more or less all that's left. We can **finally** get back to working on the house, and hopefully now we'll move much faster!
