## PSA; Dirt is dirty
After fiddling with placement, drawing and redrawing (and redrawing...) the plumbing system (learned so much about plumbing!), we were ready to start construction of the well house and dig the utility lines.

We picked up a 36" trench digger, 20" compacter, and flat bed truck from home depot on a 24 hour rental. \
And what a brutal 24 hours that was 🫠 \
Trench digging is an art, YouTube really made that one look easy..

We got everything level, and came back later with a 14" compactor to compact about 2 inches of paver base gravel.

Oh, and we staked the final placement of the house! 900 sqft is obviously on the small side, but looking at it's footprint on the ground really emphasizes its smallness, good thing we have 2 shipping containers for storage. \
Finding a good place for a dining table might be tough at this size too, hmm...

Another PSA; digging 3' trenches is hard dawg.

Anyways, blahblah we worked, and now we can pour concrete, then plumb everything, then frame👉roof👉side👉insulate the shed, and tie in the electric. \
And after that, we can take a breather while contractors build the shell of the house 😮‍💨

And just this morning we got our forest practice application approved and returned from the county! 🎉 \
(a big part of the construction permit prerequisites)

Hopefully by next post, we'll have the pressure tank and water lines plumbed and tested!
