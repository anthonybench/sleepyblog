## The mud's back, just as we're finishing the exterior
Although we still have gutters and insulation, we're agonizingly close to backfilling all of the utility trenches and getting the house and well house sided.

We have the electric rough-in nearly done (thanks Scott!) and the porch pad is getting poured tomorrow morning. \
Although I missed a picture of it, the windows just got installed today too!

I'm so tired I've practically fallen asleep 3 times now writing this, so to make a quick summary of it, all building system rough-ins are done, along with roofing and utility lines. All that's left is to backfill the trenches, install the entry door, and siding everything. We've passed electrical inspections and can get power turned on in a couple days! That's going to seriously change the game for us!
