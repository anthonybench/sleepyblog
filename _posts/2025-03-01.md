## 1 Year since we bought this land! üéâ

And what a year it's been üòÆ‚Äçüí®

I can't believe Jean and I were pushing past overgrown blackberry bushes and measuring out right triangles to survey the land, dig through bushes for survey markers, and slowly decide exactly where to pound stakes to establish where the driveway and house would be placed, exactly 12 months ago. \
It feels like so much longer that that. \
Breaks have been rare, and short lived (except for that 2 week winter holiday break). In that time we've conquered a lot, I don't aim to play any violins here, but much as it has been a rewarding journey of intense growth and self reflection, it has been incomparably trialing. I'm as grateful for it as I am anticipating it to be over.

We're probably about 70% through drywalling, and in a few weeks we may be calling in our "_sheet rock nailing inspection_". After that, it's just the final living inspection that stands between us and moving in legally.

To expedite the process, we've decided to move in as unfinished as legally allowed, meaning no finished trim, window shades, interior doors, dishwasher or laundry appliances. The house we currently live in with a friend is getting sold, so the clock is ticking, and no matter how unfinished the house is, finally living there and being down with commuting and moving will be warmly welcomed.

I'm taking a class right now, which is absurdly inconvenient, but I have to take at least 1 class a year to maintain 'active student status' for my masters degree. The course itself is quite manageable, but it's nonetheless taken from me when I had little to give already. It's slowed us down considerably, now only being able to work the weekends, and wednesday after work. I have 2 weeks left of this term, and then we can dial it back up to working every day. \
Not that that's fun or anything, but we're getting antsy, and what we need is velocity.

When spare moments are found, we've been selling or letting go of various things to downsize to make the move easier. If anyone reading this needs monitors, don't hesitate to reach out ü§£

We've covered a lot of ground in one year. It's hard to pat yourself on the back when you're frantically trying to move forward and juggling too much, but taking the few minutes to write this and reflect on every hurdle we've vaulted while working jobs and various life stuffs, I'm thankful for the life I've been given. This has been the fight of a lifetime, and I couldn't have done this without Jean. I'm not capable of imagining how brutal, or likely impossible this would have been without her.

Blahblahblah light at the end of the tunnel.
