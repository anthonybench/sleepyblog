# LinkedIn Badges

_A special mention_

Instead of using linkedin's provided dynamic link, I chose to use static images of the rendered badges because the link takes a while to load, and complexity of awaiting that fetch vs simply using images didn't warrant the rewards of doing so.

You can generate your latest linkedin profile badge [here](https://www.linkedin.com/badges/profile/create?vanityname=anthonybench&preferredlocale=en_US&trk=public_profile-settings_badge).

Take sharp screenshot images of them and update:

- `public/dark/linkedin_badge.png`
- `public/light/linkedin_badge.png`

I can't remember what size is currently used, but when you update it next, put that information here.
